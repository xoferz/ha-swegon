# Home assistant Custom component for Swegon Modbus TCP/IP

## Installation

1. Download using HACS or manually put it in the custom_components folder.
2. Add the integration (Devices and services -> Add integration)
3. Configure the integration via the configure button in the now-added integration.

## Important note

There's a drop-down where you can select many parameters for configuration. This was an attempt to be able to configure a lot of parameters without adding many entities etc. This didn't work out too well I think, as it's difficult to understand what the values are, scaling etc. I still don't think the idea's too bad though, so anyone's very much welcome to improve on this! If we find a good way to do this, it'd be easy to expand the list.
Both ZigBee and Z-Wave has some decent ways to configure devices - ZigBee the best I think. But I don't think it's possible for a custom integration to have a "Configure device" button. I would love that for other integrations as well!

## Hardware

I'm using this to convert from modbus RTU to TCP/IP:     
USR-W610: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005321384583.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.120.d2c01802wPBgq0

It's been rock solid and with industrial quality. 
It can be powered from the 24VDC output of the ventilation system.
Use an ethernet cable from the SEC/SEM connector, and a screw terminal like this:

Connect terminals 1 and 2 to the USR-W610.

## Supported devices

The integration supports CASA R4, R7, and R15. Select the device model during setup so the integration uses the corresponding Modbus datapoints. The R7 implementation includes its model-specific settings, cooker hood command, rotor speed, and summer cooling status.
